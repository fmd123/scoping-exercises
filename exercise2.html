<!-- a on line 17 is an anonymous function and its scope is inside the function createFunction.
a on line 23 is assigned to createFunction and its scope is global (not declared within in any function)
a on line 18 is inside the anonymous function which is inside the createFunction function and thus has the most interior scope.
